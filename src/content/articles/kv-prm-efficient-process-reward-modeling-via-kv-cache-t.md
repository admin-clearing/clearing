arXiv:2607.09153v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have been proven to be highly effective in guiding test-time scaling (TTS) methods, which significantly boost the capabilities of LLM-based multi-agent systems. However, existing PRMs are text-based: they re-encode the entire trajectory text from scratch. In long multi-agent rollouts, the scoring cost, growing quadratically with respect to sequence length L, creates a severe computational bottleneck, severely limiting PRMs' application in long-context scenarios. To resolve this, we introduce KV-PRM, a highly efficient process reward model that eliminates the heavy text re-encoding by directly reading the KV cache produced naturally during the LLM's generation phase. By processing a single "verify token" against the pre-existing KV cache, KV-PRM reduces the scoring cost from O(L^2) to O(L). We formally prove that the KV cache contains strictly greater information capacity than text, and is more efficient for downstream reward modeling. Empirically, across the MATH, GSM8K, and AIME benchmarks, KV-PRM matches or strictly outperforms text-PRMs under various TTS methods such as Beam Search, MCTS, and Weighted Voting, with up to a 5,000x reduction in scoring FLOPs, a 37x reduction in latency, and a 34x reduction in per-sequence memory footprint compared to text-based PRMs.
